3)
// write another express server!
// have this one send something to the front-end (a string, maybe 'hello es6!')
// oh, and try to use an es6 feature or two.
// node can use most es6 things out of the box, as long as you have `'use strict'`
// at the top of the script
// the package.json has _not_ been provided this time around.
// `const` is like `var`. check out ttps://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-const
// to understand the difference between `const` and a constant in other languages.
// `let` is like `var`, but block-scoped instead of function-scoped.
// bonus: let the user (you) set the port this server will be using

2)
// try writing a very basic api server.
// think back to the books example from the first few days of express.
// you'll need express and body-parser.
// es5 is totally fine here, but if you want to go with es6, that'd be cool too!
// we'll want to have a get, post, put, and delete
// the items (we can make these products, pets, clouds, or whatever you want)
// can just be hardcoded in
